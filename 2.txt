'Sociology' is a word which is used in many different senses. In the sense adopted here, it means the science whose object is to interpret the meaning of social action and thereby give a causal explanation of the way in which the action proceeds and the effects which it produces. By 'action' in this definition is meant human behaviour when and to the extent that the agent of agents see it as subjectively meaningful: the behaviour may be either internal or external, and may consist in the agent's doing something, omitting to do something, or having something done to him. By 'social' action is meant an action in which the meaning intended by the agent or agents involves a relation to another person's behaviour and in which that relation determines the way in which the action proceeds.
